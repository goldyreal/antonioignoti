        <h1>The War Poets</h1>
        <p>
          When the First world war broke out, thousands of men volunteered for
          military service. The reaction to war through 3 different stages:<br>1.
          The patriotic enthusiasm that led many to enlist (Brooke)<br>2. The
          realization that the War was a lie. The anger came (Sassoon).<br>3. The
          poetry gives voice to compassion and it is a sort of elegy for the
          young soldiers who must be admired and loved.<br>The War Poets took part
          in the war and managed to represent the modern times in a realistic
          way. Shell shock is a term coined during the first world war to
          describe the type of post traumatic stress disorder that many soldiers
          were with. It is a reaction to the intensity of the bombs and fighting
          that produced a sense of panic, inability to reason, sleep, walk or
          talk.
